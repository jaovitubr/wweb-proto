# WhatsApp Web Protobuf

The [package `wweb-proto`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wweb-proto) allows javascript developers to easily access the ProtoBuffer definitions used by WhatsApp Web. This enables the programmatic analysis and manipulation of messages and other data from WhatsApp Web using the [package `@bufbuild/protobuf@1.10.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf/v/1.10.0).

✨ The proto files were last modified in **WhatsApp Web version**: `{{WA_VERSION}}`.

**⚠️ This package is automatically updated when a change is detected in the proto files.**

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```sh
npm install wweb-proto
```

## Usage
The extracted and compiled ProtoBuffer definitions are ready to be used. To learn how to work with these definitions, please refer to the [`bufbuild/protobuf v1.10.0` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf/v/1.10.0).
